        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          I started my professional life as a freelance graphic designer after taking a two-year course, in parallel I studied Chemistry Technician at a
          federal institution, and worked as a trainee technician in the geochemistry laboratory at the Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), in Niter√≥i.
          But after completing my studies, I realized in technology an old passion, since I was a child I was fascinated by computers and games, so I decided to completely
          turn my life around and focus on the area of software development. I am looking for a first opportunity to evolve professionally, mainly in the area of web development,
          where the passion for technology meets the passion for design. I am fully committed to the commitments I sign and I try to be learning at any time.
